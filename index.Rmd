### Background

At the CAA 2018 Tübingen we had a session on R as archaeological tool. Within this session all papers showed a very high standard of utilisation of R for archaeological questions, and a huge variaty of different approaches.

Lively discussions on teaching R to students and colleagues followed and the question arose how we can make our preferred analytical framework more open and accessible to other interested parties.

With this background out of the audience the proposal was made to install a Special Interest Group (SIG) at CAA International to have a permanent platform to exchange and discuss, and to develop the practical benefits of R for archaeological applications.

Later in the discussion with colleagues it became clear, that it might be a good idea to also include other scripting languages like eg. python into this approach.

With this repository and these Github pages, in the spirit of open accessibility, transparency and reproducible science, we would like to start this process that will hopefully result in the installation of a SIG in Krakow 2019.

### What we will do

Within the next year we aim at installing the basic functionalities and aggree on the basic documents needed to make a sucessful bid to CAA International to have this SIG accepted as official component of the CAA universe. This especially will include

- a list of potential members and collaborators for the group
- an exchange platform for its members and also for the communication with the [scientific|archaeological|general] community
- a statement of purpose and scope of the SIG
- a document that will serve as background for the bid in Krakow 2019

### What you can do

If you are working in the field of quantitative archaeology, if you are using scripting languages as part of your analysis and daily work, and if you would like to contribute and take part in the decision making of this group, please feel free and encourage to contact us. Either through the [Github Issues Forum](https://github.com/MartinHinz/sig_sci_scripting_languages/issues), or direct via our email address:
