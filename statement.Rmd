## Statement of purpose

The purpose of the CAA Special Interest Group **Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology** is to provide an exchange platform for scientists in and around archaeology who use scripting languages to conduct major or minor parts of their research. Scientific programming in non-scripting languages is not excluded, but this SIG focusses on small scale software projects and data analysis workflows. It invites students and young career researches to become part of a wider network of developers and users to promote the use of scripting languages in research, publication and teaching in archaeology. 

A scripting language is a programming language which allows life coding interaction with an interpreter software. It does not require the compilation of a complete software module and it is therefore linked to a rapid development style suitable for scientific data analysis. The most popular scripting languages as of today not just in archaeology are R, Python and Netlogo. 

The application of scripting languages allows and forces the user to document every necessary step in a (statistical) research pipeline. The resulting script automatically is reproducible, given that also the input datasets are provided. Scripting languages are therefore the ideal environment for reproducible research. R and and Python both provide specialised frameworks to combine data, code and text (RMarkdown, Notebooks).

The special interest group tries to be as open and including as possible. Everybody is allowed to participate equally following a modern code of conduct as usually embraced in open source software development.
