Dear honorable members of the CAA Steering Committee,

we would like to establish a CAA Special Interest Group about Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology (SIG-SSLA). As the idea for this SIG was brought up in 2018 in Tübingen, we already had time for a well attended and constitutive round table meeting in 2019 in Kraków (S03 Roundtable Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology - Limits and Opportunities of Open Research) to define and discuss a statement of purpose: https://sslarch.github.io/statement.html. The SIG exists already de facto with a Google mailinglist (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scientific-scripting-languages-in-archaeology), a Github organisation (https://github.com/sslarch) and several core members.

Here the answers to the formal catalogue of questions you send us:

***

1. Title of the SIG

Special Interest Group for Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology (SIG-SSLA)

2. Short description of the SIG topic demonstrating it is in the remit of CAA

A scripting language is a programming language which allows live coding interaction with an software interpreter to perform tasks with data. It does not require the compilation of a software module (or only requires this incidentally to the main coding activity) and it is therefore linked to a rapid development style especially suitable for scientific data exploration, analysis, and visualization. The following list includes popular scripting languages in archaeology and many other sciences: R, Python, Bash, Netlogo, Stan, OxCal, Observable (JavaScript), …

The purpose of the CAA Special Interest Group for Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology is to promote the use of scripting languages in archaeology to better align the practice of archaeology with the goals of archaeological science. We will provide an exchange platform for scientists in and around archaeology who use scripting languages to conduct major or minor parts of their research.

3. Short description of planned activities demonstrating it is in line with the aims of CAA

Some of the main activities of the SIG are:
- Promote the use of scripting languages to replace widely-used black-box software with transparent and reproducible code written in open source languages
- Promote the integration of coding into the basic archaeological curriculum
- Promote the publication of archaeological research data
- Teach and provide teaching materials for scripting languages
- Discuss and comment on new developments in and for scripting languages
- Develop step-by-step pipelines for common archaeological tasks
- Define best practice standards and guides for writing, sharing and publishing code
- Construct a peer review network for code in publications and software libraries
- Establish an inheritance network to arrange long term maintenance and responsibility for software written by and for archaeologists
- Stand up for diversity and fairness in the field of computational archaeology

3. List of coordinators (at least one or more need to be current CAA members)

Martin Hinz
Sophie C. Schmidt

If you approve the formation of this SIG, we would also like to ask you if and how the SIG could get a short slot in the schedule of the CAA2020 conference in Oxford to discuss the organizational affairs among new and established members.

Thank you for considering this proposal.
Best regards,
Martin Hinz
