# Letter to the members of the SIG

Dear colleagues,

You are receiving this message because you are listed on the mailing list as a potential member of a CAA SIG 'Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology'.

This year at the CAA 2020 in Oxford we will submit a bid to have this group accepted as an official SIG of the CAA. In order to strengthen this intention, we would be pleased if you would give your support. In a preliminary enquiry to the CAA, we were told that we should illustrate in the bid that we already have some support, preferably by compiling a list of archaeologists expressing interest in this new SIG.

We would therefore appreciate it if you could inform us whether you support the attached Bid and whether we could include your name in a respective list.

Only for the bid Sophie Schmidt, Clemens Schmid and Martin Hinz will volunteer to act as coordinators. Once the bid has been accepted, a democratic process would be initiated to decide on the appointment of the coordinators. We hope that this meets with your approval.

We would be very pleased about your support.

With best regards

Sophie C. Schmidt, Martin Hinz and Clemens Schmid
